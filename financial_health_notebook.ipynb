    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many investors, lenders, and business owners rely on intuition or outdated reports when evaluating a company’s financial position. This lack of real-time, data-driven analysis can lead to poor investment or lending decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our challenge is to develop a **data-powered tool** that automatically analyzes publicly available financial data (like income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows) to assess a company’s **financial stability, profitability, and risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will simplify financial decision-making by transforming raw numbers into actionable insights through **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **data analysis and scoring system** that evaluates a company’s financial health using real-world financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To collect and preprocess financial data from **Yahoo Finance API**  \n",
    "2. To analyze key financial metrics such as revenue growth, net income, debt-to-equity ratio, and cash flow trends.  \n",
    "3. To build a **financial health scoring model** that assigns a score to each company based on performance indicators.  \n",
    "4. To visualize financial insights using clear dashboards and charts for easier interpretation.  \n",
    "5. To provide actionable recommendations for investors or business managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What financial indicators most accurately represent a company’s health and stability?  \n",
    "2. How do profitability, liquidity, and leverage ratios correlate with a company’s risk level?  \n",
    "3. Can we build a model that classifies companies into categories such as _Healthy_, _Moderate_, and _At Risk_?  \n",
    "4. How can visualizing financial trends help investors make better decisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should accurately collect and clean financial data for multiple companies.  \n",
    "- It should compute and visualize key financial ratios and trends.  \n",
    "- The scoring model should produce realistic health scores based on financial fundamentals.  \n",
    "- The final output should be clear and explainable to both technical and non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Each company dataset will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue**  \n",
    "- **Gross profit**  \n",
    "- **Operating income**  \n",
    "- **Net income**  \n",
    "- **Total assets & liabilities**  \n",
    "- **Cash flow from operations**  \n",
    "- **Debt-to-equity ratio**  \n",
    "- **Return on assets (ROA)** and **Return on equity (ROE)**  \n",
    "- **Stock price performance** over time  \n",

    "\n",
    "This section calculates the **Altman-style Z-Score**, classifies firms by financial health, provides summary diagnostics, and saves the enriched dataset for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "To compute a composite Z-Score based on liquidity, profitability, and leverage ratios, evaluate firm risk levels, and output results for downstream reporting or SME risk modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ratio Validation**  \n",
    "   - Checks for the presence of essential financial ratios:  \n",
    "     `Gross Margin`, `Operating Margin`, `ROA`, `ROE`, `Current Ratio`, `Debt to Equity`, `FCF Yield`, `CapEx Ratio`.  \n",
    "   - Logs missing ratios and continues using available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Normalization**  \n",
    "   - Converts `Decimal` values to `float` for numeric computations using the helper function `decimal_series_to_float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Z-Score Component Computation**  \n",
    "   - **A** = `Cash And Cash Equivalents / Total Assets` (liquidity)  \n",
    "   - **B** = `Net Margin` (profitability)  \n",
    "   - **C** = `Operating Margin` (operational efficiency)  \n",
    "   - **E** = `Total Revenue / Total Assets` (asset turnover)  \n",
    "   - Missing inputs are replaced with zero to preserve index alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Z-Score Assembly**  \n",
    "   - Computes weighted sum:  \n",
    "     `Z_Score = 1.2*A + 1.4*B + 3.3*C + 1.0*E`  \n",
    "   - Converts results to float to ensure compatibility with statistical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Risk Classification**  \n",
    "   - Categorizes firms based on Z-Score thresholds:  \n",
    "     - `Safe` → Z > 2.99  \n",
    "     - `Grey` → 1.81 < Z ≤ 2.99  \n",
    "     - `Distress` → Z ≤ 1.81  \n",
    "     - `Unknown` → Non-numeric or invalid values  \n",
    "   - Applies the `classify_z` helper function to derive `Z_Risk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Diagnostics and Reporting**  \n",
    "   - Logs record count, distribution of risk classifications, and sample results (`Ticker`, `Year`, `Z_Score`, `Z_Risk`).  \n",
    "   - Displays descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max) for Z-Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Export to CSV**  \n",
    "   - Creates output directory: `output/financials` (if not existing).  \n",
    "   - Saves the complete DataFrame to `output/financials/features.csv`.  \n",
    "   - Confirms successful file creation in console logs.\n",

    "- Exported file: `output/financials/features.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**  \n",
    "- Missing financial inputs default to zero for continuity but may reduce precision.  \n",
    "- `Decimal` to `float` conversion enables statistical summaries but can introduce minor rounding variance.  \n",
    "- Best used for SME financial risk profiling and early distress detection.\n"
