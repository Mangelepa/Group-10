    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many investors, lenders, and business owners rely on intuition or outdated reports when evaluating a company’s financial position. This lack of real-time, data-driven analysis can lead to poor investment or lending decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our challenge is to develop a **data-powered tool** that automatically analyzes publicly available financial data (like income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows) to assess a company’s **financial stability, profitability, and risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will simplify financial decision-making by transforming raw numbers into actionable insights through **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **data analysis and scoring system** that evaluates a company’s financial health using real-world financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To collect and preprocess financial data from **Yahoo Finance API**  \n",
    "2. To analyze key financial metrics such as revenue growth, net income, debt-to-equity ratio, and cash flow trends.  \n",
    "3. To build a **financial health scoring model** that assigns a score to each company based on performance indicators.  \n",
    "4. To visualize financial insights using clear dashboards and charts for easier interpretation.  \n",
    "5. To provide actionable recommendations for investors or business managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What financial indicators most accurately represent a company’s health and stability?  \n",
    "2. How do profitability, liquidity, and leverage ratios correlate with a company’s risk level?  \n",
    "3. Can we build a model that classifies companies into categories such as _Healthy_, _Moderate_, and _At Risk_?  \n",
    "4. How can visualizing financial trends help investors make better decisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should accurately collect and clean financial data for multiple companies.  \n",
    "- It should compute and visualize key financial ratios and trends.  \n",
    "- The scoring model should produce realistic health scores based on financial fundamentals.  \n",
    "- The final output should be clear and explainable to both technical and non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Each company dataset will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue**  \n",
    "- **Gross profit**  \n",
    "- **Operating income**  \n",
    "- **Net income**  \n",
    "- **Total assets & liabilities**  \n",
    "- **Cash flow from operations**  \n",
    "- **Debt-to-equity ratio**  \n",
    "- **Return on assets (ROA)** and **Return on equity (ROE)**  \n",
    "- **Stock price performance** over time  \n",

    "These metrics help us assess profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency — the four main pillars of financial health.\n",
