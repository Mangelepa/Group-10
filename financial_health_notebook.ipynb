    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many investors, lenders, and business owners rely on intuition or outdated reports when evaluating a company’s financial position. This lack of real-time, data-driven analysis can lead to poor investment or lending decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our challenge is to develop a **data-powered tool** that automatically analyzes publicly available financial data (like income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows) to assess a company’s **financial stability, profitability, and risk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will simplify financial decision-making by transforming raw numbers into actionable insights through **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **data analysis and scoring system** that evaluates a company’s financial health using real-world financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To collect and preprocess financial data from **Yahoo Finance API**  \n",
    "2. To analyze key financial metrics such as revenue growth, net income, debt-to-equity ratio, and cash flow trends.  \n",
    "3. To build a **financial health scoring model** that assigns a score to each company based on performance indicators.  \n",
    "4. To visualize financial insights using clear dashboards and charts for easier interpretation.  \n",
    "5. To provide actionable recommendations for investors or business managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What financial indicators most accurately represent a company’s health and stability?  \n",
    "2. How do profitability, liquidity, and leverage ratios correlate with a company’s risk level?  \n",
    "3. Can we build a model that classifies companies into categories such as _Healthy_, _Moderate_, and _At Risk_?  \n",
    "4. How can visualizing financial trends help investors make better decisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system should accurately collect and clean financial data for multiple companies.  \n",
    "- It should compute and visualize key financial ratios and trends.  \n",
    "- The scoring model should produce realistic health scores based on financial fundamentals.  \n",
    "- The final output should be clear and explainable to both technical and non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Each company dataset will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue**  \n",
    "- **Gross profit**  \n",
    "- **Operating income**  \n",
    "- **Net income**  \n",

    "- **Return on assets (ROA)** and **Return on equity (ROE)**  \n",
    "- **Stock price performance** over time  \n",

    "Here wen locates, standardizes, and utilizes the correct equity-related column in a financial dataset to compute two essential profitability ratios: **Return on Assets (ROA)** and **Return on Equity (ROE)**. These metrics are key indicators of how efficiently a company generates profit relative to its assets and shareholder equity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \r\n",
    "To ensure consistent equity data labeling and to calculate ROA and ROE safely with high decimal precision.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Equity Column Detection**\r\n",
    "   - Searches the DataFrame’s columns for terms matching common equity-related keywords (e.g., “stockholder equity”, “shareholders equity”, “total equity”).\r\n",
    "   - Assigns the first match found as the standardized column `\"Total Stockholder Equity\"`.\r\n",
    "   - If no match is detected, a new column is created with a zero fallback value, and a warning message is printed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Column Standardization**\r\n",
    "   - If the detected equity column name differs from `\"Total Stockholder Equity\"`, it is renamed for consistency.\r\n",
    "   - If already standardized, a message confirms this.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Computation of Profitability Ratios**\r\n",
    "   - Validates the presence of the required columns:\r\n",
    "     - `Net Income`\r\n",
    "     - `Total Assets`\r\n",
    "     - `Total Stockholder Equity`\r\n",
    "   - If available, computes:\r\n",
    "     - **ROA (Return on Assets)** = `Net Income / Total Assets`\r\n",
    "     - **ROE (Return on Equity)** = `Net Income / Total Stockholder Equity`\r\n",
    "   - Both calculations use `vec_safe_div` to ensure decimal-safe division and prevent divide-by-zero errors.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection**\r\n",
    "   - Logs warnings if either ROA or ROE contains negative values, signaling potential operational losses or equity deterioration.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Outputs:**\r\n",
    "- A standardized equity column (`\"Total Stockholder Equity\"`).  \r\n",
    "- Two new calculated columns:\r\n",
    "  - `ROA`\r\n",
    "  - `ROE`\r\n",
    "- Console logs detailing missing columns, renaming actions, or negative ratio findings.\r\n",

    "This section calculates the **Altman-style Z-Score**, classifies firms by financial health, provides summary diagnostics, and saves the enriched dataset for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "To compute a composite Z-Score based on liquidity, profitability, and leverage ratios, evaluate firm risk levels, and output results for downstream reporting or SME risk modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ratio Validation**  \n",
    "   - Checks for the presence of essential financial ratios:  \n",
    "     `Gross Margin`, `Operating Margin`, `ROA`, `ROE`, `Current Ratio`, `Debt to Equity`, `FCF Yield`, `CapEx Ratio`.  \n",
    "   - Logs missing ratios and continues using available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Normalization**  \n",
    "   - Converts `Decimal` values to `float` for numeric computations using the helper function `decimal_series_to_float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Z-Score Component Computation**  \n",
    "   - **A** = `Cash And Cash Equivalents / Total Assets` (liquidity)  \n",
    "   - **B** = `Net Margin` (profitability)  \n",
    "   - **C** = `Operating Margin` (operational efficiency)  \n",
    "   - **E** = `Total Revenue / Total Assets` (asset turnover)  \n",
    "   - Missing inputs are replaced with zero to preserve index alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Z-Score Assembly**  \n",
    "   - Computes weighted sum:  \n",
    "     `Z_Score = 1.2*A + 1.4*B + 3.3*C + 1.0*E`  \n",
    "   - Converts results to float to ensure compatibility with statistical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Risk Classification**  \n",
    "   - Categorizes firms based on Z-Score thresholds:  \n",
    "     - `Safe` → Z > 2.99  \n",
    "     - `Grey` → 1.81 < Z ≤ 2.99  \n",
    "     - `Distress` → Z ≤ 1.81  \n",
    "     - `Unknown` → Non-numeric or invalid values  \n",
    "   - Applies the `classify_z` helper function to derive `Z_Risk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Diagnostics and Reporting**  \n",
    "   - Logs record count, distribution of risk classifications, and sample results (`Ticker`, `Year`, `Z_Score`, `Z_Risk`).  \n",
    "   - Displays descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max) for Z-Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Export to CSV**  \n",
    "   - Creates output directory: `output/financials` (if not existing).  \n",

    "- Exported file: `output/financials/features.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**  \n",
    "- Missing financial inputs default to zero for continuity but may reduce precision.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Here we visualize the model’s discriminatory power using **ROC-AUC curves** for both binary and multiclass classification setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Detect the number of target classes.  \n",
    "2. For binary classification, plot a single ROC curve and compute the AUC score.  \n",
    "3. For multiclass problems, binarize labels and plot per-class ROC curves, including a micro-average curve.  \n",
    "4. Display the resulting ROC-AUC values to assess model performance across classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "- ROC curves plotted for binary or multiclass cases.  \n",
    "- AUC scores printed per class (and overall micro-average).\n"

    "The project successfully addressed the initial stages of the business objective: transforming raw financial data into actionable features for a scoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Robust Data Pipeline: A scalable pipeline was created to fetch financial data (Income Statements, Balance Sheets, Cash Flows) for a large universe of tickers (503 tickers achieved) directly from the Yahoo Finance API using yfinance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Standardization: A critical resolve_item_names function was implemented using fuzzy matching to reliably map inconsistent raw row names from the API (like \"Total Revenues\" or \"Total Revenue\") to standardized clean feature names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive Feature Set: Over 12 core financial features were engineered, covering the following pillars of financial health:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Profitability Ratios: Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, ROA, and ROE.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Liquidity & Leverage Ratios: Current Ratio and Debt to Equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Solvency Score: The Altman Z-Score was computed as a primary, multi-factor indicator of bankruptcy risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Quality and Precision: All financial calculations utilized Python's Decimal type via a vec_safe_div function to ensure high arithmetic precision and prevent division-by-zero errors."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "Based on the data framework the following steps were done:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pipeline Success & Scalability: The project has built a robust, enterprise-grade data engineering foundation capable of ingesting and cleaning data for a large number of companies efficiently. This fulfills the requirement for a real-time, data-driven analysis tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initial Risk Insight (Z-Score): The Altman Z-Score analysis provides a baseline risk profile for the ticker universe. The statistics show a Mean Z-Score of 1.34 and a Median of 1.28. Since a Z-Score below 1.81 is classified as 'Distress', this suggests that, according to the Z-Score model, the average company in the sample exhibits significant financial distress risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Quality Audit: The audit revealed a minimal number of unexpected negative values in fields like Gross Profit (1 instance) and Net Income (22 instances). The existence of these negative values is valid for loss-making companies but confirms the importance of the cleaning steps to prevent critical errors in ratio calculations."

    "To achieve the remaining business objectives (creating the final scoring model, visualization, and actionable advice), the following steps are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete the Scoring Model: The next critical step is to utilize the engineered features (ratios, Z-Score) to build the final Financial Health Scoring Model . The notebook is set up for an XGBoost Classifier, which should be trained to predict the Z_Risk categories or a custom, synthesized financial health score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Explainability: The project should leverage SHAP (already imported) to interpret the final model's predictions, ensuring the output is clear and explainable to both technical and non-technical users (a key success criterion). This will justify the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build the Visualization Layer: Develop the planned clear dashboards and charts  to present the Z-Score distribution, key ratio trends over time, and the final predicted health score for each company, allowing for easier interpretation of financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate Actionable Advice: The final output should include logic to translate the resulting health score (e.g., 'Safe', 'Grey', 'Distress') into actionable recommendations for investors or business managers. For example, a \"Distress\" score should trigger a recommendation to \"Review debt covenants and cost management.\""
